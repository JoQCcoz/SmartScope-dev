Beta Program
=========================
.. note:: SmartScope is currently holding a closed beta testing program.

We want SmartScope to provide a great user experience and want to polish the software and documentation before release.

During the closed beta phase, the source code will only be made available with the testers. The goal will be to test in different environments and on multiple hardware types (detectors and microscopes).

We will work closely with testers with their initial setup and obtain feedback.

If you would like to contribute to the codebase during the closed beta period, please email us for inquiries.

To enroll in the closed beta, please `email us <./contact.html>`_.
