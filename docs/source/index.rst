===============
.. note:: This documentation website is still under construction.

SmartScope is a framework for automated cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM). 
The main purpose is to automate specimen screening, document the process, and provide a portal for visualization and interaction with the microscope.
The software bundles a database, the main imaging workflow and a web user-inteface for easy access. 
To run Smartscope, simply fill the form about which grids to be screened, press start and wait for live results to come in.

The source code can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/NIEHS/SmartScope>`_.
