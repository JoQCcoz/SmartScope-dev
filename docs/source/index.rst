===============
.. note:: This documentation website is still under construction.

SmartScope is a framework for automated cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM). 
The main purpose is to automate specimen screening, document the process, and provide a portal for visualization and interaction with the microscope.
The software bundles a database, the main imaging workflow and a web user-inteface for easy access. 
To run Smartscope, simply fill the form about which grids to be screened, press start and wait for live results to come in.
